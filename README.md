This is a simple flood forecasting application for the Caribbean
State of Haiti, paid for by the World Bank. This PC based App 
allows users to enter rainfall data for their neighbourhood, 
and it would use the data to select a pre-modelled flood 
scenario that was most likely to happen. The app 
would then display maps showing the areas where flooding 
would occur, providing the local government with 
an early warning. Although simple, it was very effective 
and well received, and was subsequently rolled out by the 
World Bank in Uganda, for the city of Kampala.
